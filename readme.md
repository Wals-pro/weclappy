# weclappy

The weclapp Python Client.

There is no lightweight, simple weclapp client library available for Python currently. Let's build it together.

## Overview

The goal of this library is to provide a minimal, threaded client that handles pagination effectively when fetching lists from the weclapp API. It is capable of retrieving large volumes of data by parallelizing page requests, significantly reducing wait times. This library is designed to be lean with no unnecessary bloat, allowing you to get started very quickly.

## Features

- **Threaded Pagination:** Fetch multiple pages concurrently for enhanced performance.
- **Minimal Dependencies:** Only dependency is [`requests`](https://pypi.org/project/requests/).
- **Simplicity:** A lean bloat free solution to interact with the weclapp API.
- **Open Source:** Free to use in any project, with contributions and improvements highly welcome.

## Installation

Install the package via pip:

```bash
pip install weclapp
```

## Quick Start

```python

from weclapp import Weclapp

# Initialize the client with your base URL and API key
client = Weclapp("https://acme.weclapp.com/webapp/api/v1", "your_api_key")

# Fetch a single entity by ID, e.g., 'salesOrder' with ID '12345'
sales_order = client.get("salesOrder", id="12345")

# Fetch paginated results for an entity, e.g., 'salesOrder' with a filter
sales_orders = client.get_all("salesOrder", { "salesOrderPaymentType-eq": "ADVANCE_PAYMENT" }, threaded=True)

# Create a new entity, e.g., 'salesOrder'
new_sales_order = client.post("salesOrder", { "customerId": "12345", "commission": "Hello, world!" })

# Update an existing entity, e.g., 'salesOrder' with ID '12345', ignoreMissingProperties is True per default
updated_sales_order = client.put("salesOrder", id="12345", data={ "commission": "Hello, universe!" })

# Delete an entity, e.g., 'salesOrder' with ID '12345'
client.delete("salesOrder", id="12345")

```

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome. Any improvements, bug fixes, or new features are gladly accepted. Let’s build this client together to make working with the weclapp API as efficient as possible.
